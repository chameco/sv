Features:
I have included equivalent proofs in Idris (alongside my Athena proofs), which is a general purpose functional language with dependent types (which make it suitable as a proof assistant by the Curry-Howard isomorphism).
These may or may not be interesting to look at.
Simpler proofs like the ones here are a good deal shorter in Idris, since equality is automatically checked on beta-reduced terms: this corresponds to not needing the axiomatic reductions found in Athena equality chains.
Furthermore, the properties proved relate to actual programs, so the addition, multiplication, and exponentiation functions defined can actually be used.
I expect Idris to become less suitable as the course progresses and more involved proofs are necessary, as it is not primarily used as a proof assistant, but I intend to try.
Regardless, it has been a good experience so far and I would be interested in demonstrating some of Idris' features at the end of class sometime.

Bugs:
None that I am aware of. Athena verifies the theorems and I do not believe there are any extraneous axioms.
